# Building-a-Simple-Movie-Data-Pipeline
This project builds an end-to-end ETL data pipeline that extracts movie data from MovieLens, enriches it with details from the OMDb API, and loads it into a SQL database. Using Python (Pandas, SQLAlchemy), it cleans, transforms, and stores data to enable analytics like top-rated movies and popular genres.
